# Releasing lingtai-tui and lingtai-portal

## Release Process

### 1. Commit and push all changes

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Tag the release

```bash
git tag v0.X.Y
git push origin v0.X.Y
```

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers the root GitHub Actions workflow at
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. That workflow computes the source tarball
checksum and updates `Lingtai-AI/homebrew-lingtai` automatically.

### 3. Create the GitHub release

```bash
gh release create v0.X.Y --title "v0.X.Y" --notes "release notes here..."
```

No binary assets needed — Homebrew builds from source, Linux users build locally.

### 4. Verify the automated Homebrew tap update

Check the `Release` workflow run for the tag and confirm it pushed a formula
update to `Lingtai-AI/homebrew-lingtai`.

```bash
gh run list --workflow Release --event push --limit 5
gh run watch <run-id>
```

Then verify the installed version:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade lingtai-ai/lingtai/lingtai-tui
lingtai-tui version  # should show v0.X.Y
```

### 5. Fallback: update the Homebrew tap manually

Use this only when the root release workflow failed or cannot run. Do not race a
successful workflow with a hand edit.

```bash
# Get the source tarball checksum
curl -sL "https://github.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai/archive/refs/tags/v0.X.Y.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256

# Edit the formula
cd $(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/lingtai-ai/homebrew-lingtai
# In lingtai-tui.rb: update the url tag and sha256
git add lingtai-tui.rb
git commit -m "bump lingtai-tui to v0.X.Y"
git push
```

The inactive `tui/.github/workflows/release.yml` path is intentionally not part
of the release process; GitHub only runs workflows from the repository-root
`.github/workflows/` directory. Existing npm package files are outside this
release checklist and are not decided here.

## Installing without Homebrew

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai.git
cd lingtai/tui && make build
# Binary at tui/bin/lingtai-tui

cd ../portal && make build
# Binary at portal/bin/lingtai-portal
```

Requires Go toolchain and Node.js (for portal web frontend).
