# Releasing lingtai-tui and lingtai-portal

## Release Process

### 1. Commit and push all changes

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Tag the release

```bash
git tag v0.X.Y
git push origin v0.X.Y
```

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers the root GitHub Actions workflow at
`.github/workflows/release.yml`, which has three jobs:

- **`source-release`** — verifies the pushed tag and creates the public GitHub
  Release when it does not already exist. GitHub supplies the tag source archives;
  this job does not build or upload prebuilt binaries, checksums, or bundles.
- **`update-homebrew`** — computes the GitHub source-tarball checksum and updates
  the source-build formula in `Lingtai-AI/homebrew-lingtai`.
- **`windows-release`** (`needs: source-release`) — builds both
  `lingtai-tui.exe` and `lingtai-portal.exe` for `windows/amd64`; the portal web
  build is mandatory. It packages the dual-binary
  `lingtai-<tag>-windows-amd64.zip` plus its `.sha256` sidecar, generates
  `lingtai-bundle-manifest.json` (schema `lingtai.tui.bundle/v1`) binding the tag's
  exact commit to the archive digest and to [`kernel-release.json`](kernel-release.json)'s
  pinned kernel tag, and uploads all three to the release. It **fails closed**
  before building anything unless `kernel-release.json`'s pinned kernel release
  already exists and publishes a `cp311`/`cp312`/`cp313` `win_amd64` wheel with a
  verified digest — it never resolves "latest kernel."

### Kernel compatibility metadata

[`kernel-release.json`](kernel-release.json) is the repo-owned pin the
`windows-release` job reads to bind a TUI release to one exact kernel release.
Bump it deliberately, in the same PR/commit that intends to ship a new kernel
version with the next TUI release; the workflow never resolves "latest kernel"
on its own.

### Gitee publication

The tag workflow does not synchronize to Gitee and does not publish TUI
binary/bundle assets there. The existing
[`scripts/sync_gitee_mirror.sh`](scripts/sync_gitee_mirror.sh) and
[`scripts/publish_bundle_to_gitee.sh`](scripts/publish_bundle_to_gitee.sh)
remain explicit maintainer tools; running them requires separate release authority
and is not part of the automatic `v*` workflow.

### Installing on Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://lingtai.ai/install.ps1 | iex
# or an exact version (parameters require the scriptblock form, not | iex):
&([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://lingtai.ai/install.ps1))) -Version v0.X.Y
```

`install.ps1`'s public (default) mode resolves one exact release tag, downloads
and strictly validates `lingtai-bundle-manifest.json`, downloads and SHA-256
verifies the Windows archive, confirms the staged `lingtai-tui.exe` reports
exactly that tag, and — unless `-SkipVenv` is passed — provisions
`%USERPROFILE%\.lingtai-tui\runtime\venv` from the bundle's pinned kernel
release: it selects the `cp311`/`cp312`/`cp313` `win_amd64` wheel matching the
venv's actual interpreter, verifies its digest, and installs it by explicit
local file path. LingTai is never installed by package name from any index —
the same "no PyPI fallback" contract `install.sh` holds itself to. `-SkipVenv`
skips only the kernel venv and still installs both required TUI/portal binaries;
`-DryRun` performs the same resolution/validation reads but writes nothing. The
Windows Installer Smoke workflow covers the contract suite under PowerShell 5.1
and PowerShell 7 on PR/push; its tag-only exact-tag smoke waits for the published
asset and verifies both installed binaries. See
[`scripts/test-install-ps1.ps1`](scripts/test-install-ps1.ps1) for the full
contract and [`.github/workflows/windows-installer-smoke.yml`](.github/workflows/windows-installer-smoke.yml)
for its Windows PowerShell 5.1 / PowerShell 7 CI coverage.

### 3. Create the GitHub release

The `source-release` job creates the GitHub release, and `windows-release` adds
the dual-binary ZIP, checksum sidecar, and bundle manifest. To create a release
manually (or to add richer notes), run:

```bash
gh release create v0.X.Y --title "v0.X.Y" --notes "release notes here..."
```

Binary assets are attached by the workflow. If the workflow could not run, the
release still installs — `install.sh` falls back to building from the release
source tarball.

### 4. Verify the automated Homebrew tap update

Check the `Release` workflow run for the tag and confirm it pushed a formula
update to `Lingtai-AI/homebrew-lingtai`.

```bash
gh run list --workflow Release --event push --limit 5
gh run watch <run-id>
```

Then verify the installed version:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade lingtai-ai/lingtai/lingtai-tui
lingtai-tui version  # should show v0.X.Y
```

### 5. Fallback: update the Homebrew tap manually

Use this only when the root release workflow failed or cannot run. Do not race a
successful workflow with a hand edit.

```bash
# Get the source tarball checksum
curl -sL "https://github.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai/archive/refs/tags/v0.X.Y.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256

# Edit the formula
cd $(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/lingtai-ai/homebrew-lingtai
# In lingtai-tui.rb: update the url tag and sha256
git add lingtai-tui.rb
git commit -m "bump lingtai-tui to v0.X.Y"
git push
```

The inactive `tui/.github/workflows/release.yml` path is intentionally not part
of the release process; GitHub only runs workflows from the repository-root
`.github/workflows/` directory. Existing npm package files are outside this
release checklist and are not decided here.

## Installing without Homebrew

The tag workflow publishes both GitHub source archives and the verified Windows
bundle assets described above. Homebrew and the manual commands below still
build `lingtai-tui` and `lingtai-portal` from the tagged source when a source
build is preferred:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://lingtai.ai/install.sh | bash
# or, direct from the repo:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai/main/install.sh | bash
```

Manual source build (if you prefer to build the binaries yourself):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lingtai-AI/lingtai.git
cd lingtai/tui && make build
# Binary at tui/bin/lingtai-tui

cd ../portal && make build
# Binary at portal/bin/lingtai-portal
```

Requires Go toolchain and Node.js (for portal web frontend).

### Source selection (GitHub vs Gitee) and the Python runtime

The POSIX installer has one explicit non-release mode:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://lingtai.ai/install.sh | bash -s -- --latest
```

`--latest` resolves `refs/heads/main` independently in the TUI repository and
`lingtai-kernel`, verifies each shallow checkout against its resolved full SHA,
builds the TUI from source, and installs the kernel from the checked-out local
source tree. It prints both SHAs and records them in `~/.lingtai-tui/install.json`
under `source_mode: "latest-main"`, `tui_commit`, and `kernel_commit`. This mode
is deliberately separate from the no-argument/latest-release, `--version`,
`--ref`, and `--update` paths; conflicts fail before network access, and a
failed main checkout or kernel install never falls back to a stable release or
package-index install. It is POSIX-only; `install.ps1` is unchanged.

The behavior below applies to the bundle assets published by the tag workflow
and to compatible bundle releases published separately. Gitee synchronization
and bundle publication remain explicit maintainer tools; the tag workflow does
not invoke them.

`install.sh --source auto|github|gitee` (or `LINGTAI_SOURCE` env var) controls
where the TUI/portal archives, the bundle manifest, and the pinned kernel
release come from. `auto` (the default) runs a bounded, fail-open public-IP
country lookup and prefers Gitee for mainland-China installs; any lookup or
provider-reachability failure falls back to GitHub. A fallback always re-fetches
the SAME resolved tag/bundle from the other provider — it never independently
resolves "latest" a second time, so a TUI archive from one release can never be
paired with a kernel artifact from a different one.

The Python `lingtai` runtime installs from the bundle's pinned kernel release
artifact (a platform wheel matched to the venv's actual interpreter, or the
pinned sdist as a fallback) by **explicit local file path**. LingTai is
**never** installed by requesting the package name `lingtai` from any package
index — there is no PyPI fallback for LingTai itself. SHA256 is verified
before install. One package index is then used only to resolve the local
artifact's third-party dependencies: an explicit `LINGTAI_PYPI_INDEX_URL`
always wins; otherwise a final Gitee bundle uses Tsinghua TUNA
(`https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pypi/web/simple`) and a final GitHub
bundle uses `https://pypi.org/simple`. Same-tag provider fallback updates this
default together with the final bundle provider.

On the default one-command path (no `--ref`, not `--update`) a resolved
bundle + a successful kernel-artifact install are **mandatory**: if no bundle
manifest can be resolved on either provider (same-tag fallback attempted), or
the resolved bundle's kernel artifact fails to verify or install, `install.sh`
**fails loud** with the provider/tag/error rather than degrading to any other
install source. `--ref`/source-ref builds have no bundle to pin against and
fail loud the same way. `--skip-python` (alias `--skip-venv`) is the explicit,
honest opt-out for a TUI/portal-only install — you then provision the Python
runtime yourself (for example an editable install against a local
`lingtai-kernel` checkout).

`install.json`'s `kernel_source` field is written only on a verified bundle
install (`kernel_source: "bundle"`, plus `kernel_bundle_id`/`kernel_version`/
`kernel_provider`); it is omitted otherwise. The TUI's own runtime updater
(`tui/internal/config/venv.go`) reads this field and skips **both routine and
forced** PyPI queries/installs for a bundle-provisioned runtime — `force=true`
(`doctor`/`/update --force`) reports that the kernel is pinned to the
compatible bundle and directs the user to the one-command installer rather
than reinterpreting "force" as "discard the pin and install latest PyPI."
Legacy runtimes with no `kernel_source` metadata are unaffected: the updater's
existing PyPI-compare/upgrade behavior is unchanged for them, since retracting
that established capability is out of scope here — but the CLI no longer
*introduces* a new PyPI install source for LingTai on a fresh install.
