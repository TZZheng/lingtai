# `claude-agent-sdk`

`claudeAgentSDKPreset()` uses provider `claude-agent-sdk`, the CLI model alias
`opus`, and the user’s local Claude Code login. The underlying Claude Opus
model is vision-capable, and interactive Claude Code accepts image input, but
that does not establish image forwarding through the programmatic Agent SDK
`query()` surface. The shipped manifest intentionally has no API key env-var,
base URL, web-search override, or LingTai `vision` capability. No separate
Claude plan-level vision MCP was established by the reviewed evidence.

Read the official [Claude vision guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision),
[Claude Code common workflows](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows),
and [Agent SDK overview](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview)
when current CLI capabilities matter. If the local SDK route cannot handle an
image, report that limitation; do not invent an HTTP endpoint, guess auth, or
auto-load/invoke an MCP. Recheck TUI source for the alias and conservative
capability wiring. The TUI does not store or reproduce the local login
credentials.
