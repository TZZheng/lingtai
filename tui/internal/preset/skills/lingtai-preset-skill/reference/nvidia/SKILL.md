# `nvidia`

`nvidiaPreset()` ships exact model `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct` at
`https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1` with OpenAI compatibility and
`NVIDIA_API_KEY`. This default model is text-only and the manifest has no
`vision` capability.

The same hosted gateway may offer other VLM slugs, but a clone selecting one
still needs an explicit `capabilities.vision` entry; changing only `llm.model`
does not wire a LingTai vision route. Read the official [NVIDIA API Catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/),
[model catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/models), and [NIM API reference](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/nim/reference/llm-apis)
on demand. No NVIDIA plan-level vision MCP is established. Do not switch
providers or auto-load/invoke an MCP. Recheck TUI source for the template
fields after changes. Never guess a key or copy the volatile catalog into this
manual.
