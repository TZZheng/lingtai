# `openrouter`

`openrouterPreset()` ships gateway model `z-ai/glm-5.1`, provider
`openrouter`, a provider-resolved base URL, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. The exact
shipped slug is text-in/text-out, and the manifest has no `vision` capability.
OpenRouter image support ultimately depends on the selected downstream model;
gateway-wide multimodality does not prove that the current model supports images.
The vision tool therefore tries the current endpoint, model, and credential over
the OpenAI-compatible route by default instead of blocking on a preflight guess.

Read the official [OpenRouter model guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/overview/models)
and [image-understanding guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/overview/multimodal/image-understanding)
on demand. No OpenRouter plan-level vision MCP is evidenced. If the real image
request fails, the sanitized vision tool result reports the failure type and
points to `vision(action="manual")` for explicit alternatives. Do not silently
change model/provider or auto-load/invoke an MCP. Verify provider, model,
endpoint resolution, and capability flags in TUI source.
