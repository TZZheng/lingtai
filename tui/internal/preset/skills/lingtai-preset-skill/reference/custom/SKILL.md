# `custom`

`customPreset()` is a user-supplied OpenAI-compatible template: model is
empty until configured, the key slot is `LLM_API_KEY`, and the endpoint is
user-supplied. Its `vision` capability inherits the configured LLM endpoint.
Whether images work is therefore unknown until the actual provider, model,
protocol, and endpoint are identified. The vision tool still tries the current
OpenAI-compatible endpoint, model, and credential by default instead of treating
that uncertainty as setup-time manual-only.

Read the configured endpoint’s official documentation on demand. Useful
protocol references are the [OpenAI Chat API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat),
[Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages), or
[Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs), as applicable; none is a
claim about an unspecified endpoint. No plan-level vision MCP can be asserted.

If direct vision fails, report the endpoint-specific limitation and let the
agent choose an explicit skill. Do not guess credentials, switch providers, or
auto-load/invoke an MCP. Verify all inherited fields in TUI source and inspect
the saved manifest for the user’s actual configuration.
