# Tutorial Guide — Capabilities Lesson

Nested tutorial-guide reference for capabilities lesson 9.

Use this file after the root `tutorial-guide` router sends you here. Keep teaching live: discover current files, commands, and runtime state before explaining them.

## Lesson 9: Capabilities

Capabilities are pluggable tools declared in init.json.

### Part 1: Avatar — the crown jewel

Walk through a full network explosion exercise:
1. Spawn 3 avatars with distinct names/personalities
2. Invite human to check **/kanban** and **/viz**
3. Chain spawn — ask each avatar to spawn 2 more
4. Cross-network email storm — have all avatars introduce themselves
5. Watch it get out of control — this is the teaching moment about exponential growth
6. Emergency brake — **/suspend all** to kill the entire network
7. Show delegates/ledger.jsonl

### Part 2: All other capabilities

**Discover your capabilities dynamically** — use `system(show)` to list your actual loaded capabilities. Walk through each one you find, one at a time. For each:
1. Explain what it does
2. Demonstrate it live
3. Invite the human to try

Do not rely on a hardcoded list — your capabilities depend on what was configured in init.json.
