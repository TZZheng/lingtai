# `/update-tui`

Nested `lingtai-update` reference. `/update-tui` compares the running TUI with
the latest GitHub release, detects the install method, and requires explicit
confirmation before changing the TUI binary; the selected distribution may also
refresh the co-installed portal binary. It never updates the Python kernel,
presets, or utility library, and never auto-restarts the current TUI — relaunch
after a successful update.

- Homebrew: runs `brew upgrade lingtai-ai/lingtai/lingtai-tui`.
- Source/user-local: runs the versioned `install.sh --update --prefix ...
  --version <tag> --non-interactive` path and verifies the result.
- Unknown/other or non-comparable/dev versions: reports guidance and does not
  guess a package manager.

`lingtai-tui self-update` is the shell command for the same manual update
surface when the interactive TUI is unavailable. `lingtai-tui doctor` is a
broader repair/report path that can also run the detected TUI backend; use this
skill only for its TUI/portal side and defer Python-runtime decisions to the
kernel `system-manual` runtime/kernel update manual.
