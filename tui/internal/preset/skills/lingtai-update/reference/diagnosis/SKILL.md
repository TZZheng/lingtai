# Failure diagnosis

Nested `lingtai-update` reference. Start with read-only identity checks:

```bash
lingtai-tui doctor
lingtai-tui version
command -v lingtai-tui lingtai-portal
```

If `/update-tui` says unknown, inspect the reported executable and the
TUI-owned `~/.lingtai-tui/install.json`; do not substitute Homebrew. If a
source update fails, confirm its prefix/bin directory still exists and that the
requested tag is a strict `vX.Y.Z` release. If a Homebrew update fails, run
`brew update`, then inspect `brew info lingtai-ai/lingtai/lingtai-tui` and the
formula source before retrying. A successful binary update still requires a
fresh process: quit and relaunch the TUI.

For source-build failures, separate Go module fetches from the portal's
`npm ci`/frontend build. On asset download failure the installer is designed to
fall back to a source build; record the release tag, OS/architecture, and the
first actionable error rather than retrying blindly. Never paste environment
dumps, tokens, or private paths into reports. Python import, venv, or kernel
errors are outside this skill; follow the kernel's `system-manual`
runtime/kernel update manual.
