# Install and build

Nested `lingtai-update` reference. The supported public first-install path is:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://lingtai.ai/install.sh | bash
```

`install.sh` resolves one release bundle through `--source auto|github|gitee`
(or `LINGTAI_SOURCE`), prefers a matching
`lingtai-<tag>-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz` asset, and falls back on the same tag or builds
the release source when no asset is available. It installs both binaries into a
selected bin directory and prepares the TUI-managed runtime; that runtime is not
a second TUI update path. For the local runtime artifact's third-party
dependencies, explicit `LINGTAI_PYPI_INDEX_URL` wins; otherwise a final Gitee
bundle uses Tsinghua TUNA and a final GitHub bundle uses official PyPI.

For a deliberate source build, the current repository layout is:

```bash
cd tui && make build
cd ../portal && make build
```

The portal build first needs its checked-in web dependencies and frontend build
(`cd portal/web && npm ci && npm run build`); `portal/embed.go` then embeds the
result into `lingtai-portal`. Go and Node are build prerequisites, not runtime
dependencies of the portal binary.

The installer accepts `--version <tag>`, `--ref <ref>`, `--bin-dir <dir>` or
`--prefix <dir>`; its `--update --prefix <prefix> --version <tag>
--non-interactive` form is the source updater contract. Prefer the public
`lingtai.ai` URL for new installs. Homebrew remains a supported migration path;
bare `pip install/upgrade lingtai` is kernel development/diagnosis guidance, not
normal TUI update guidance.
