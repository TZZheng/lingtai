  This contract defines what the TUI needs to launch and run, classified by
  whether each requirement is project-scoped (R1), derived from the agent
  source of truth (R2), or purely additive user-level state (R3). The startup
  decision table, doctor checks, and degraded-launch behavior must all be
  derivable from these three classes — never added as one-off patches.
  Keep it reciprocal with docs/tui-agent-alignment.md and with the config
  resolution code (ResolveKeys / ReadEnvKeys / HasAPIKeys). When a
  requirement class or a concrete additive item changes, update this contract
  and the doctor checks that validate against it together. Bump
  contract_version for a breaking change to the requirement classes. Keep
  the selected-Agent headless control boundary reciprocal with
  tui/internal/tui/control.go and tui/control_headless_test.go.

# TUI Runtime Contract

## Definition principle

An agent is defined **solely** by `<project>/.lingtai/<agent>/init.json`
(identity, manifest, addons, env_file). Everything it needs at runtime derives
from that file, its env_file, and the installed kernel.

The TUI is defined the same way: it manages the project-scoped network
(`<project>/.lingtai/`) and therefore depends on the same R1/R2 requirements
as the agents it runs. On top of that it has a small, **purely additive** set
of user-level requirements under `~/.lingtai-tui/` (R3).

**Additive invariant:** a missing R3 item must **never** block launch. Every
R3 item has a default value and a defined degradation; the startup decision
table gates only on R1/R2. This is what makes the system robust: losing a
preferences file is a degraded condition with a defined response, not a setup
event and not a surprise.

## Requirement classes

### R1 · Project-scoped (required, sourced from the network)

| Requirement | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Agents exist | `<project>/.lingtai/<agent>/init.json` | zero agents → real first-run setup |
| Runtime/kernel | installed kernel + venv | readiness check; bootstrap gated on human consent |
| Agent env | `<project>/.lingtai/<agent>/init.json` env_file | defines where agents load `.env` |

### R2 · Derived from the agent source of truth (.env)

| Requirement | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| API keys | `~/.lingtai-tui/.env` (via `ResolveKeys`) | agents load this at boot; `.env` is authoritative |

### R3 · Purely additive (user-level, loss must not block launch)

Every item below has a default and a defined degradation. The doctor
validates the launch-relevant subset (R1/R2/R3.1) programmatically via the
D1-D5 checks below; R3.2/R3.3 load defaults silently by design and are not
examined by the doctor.

| ID | Item | Location | Default | Degradation when missing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R3.1 | `keys` mirror | `~/.lingtai-tui/config.json` `keys` | none (derived from `.env`) | Keys still resolve from `.env` (R2) and every TUI key consumer reads through `ResolveKeys`, so the mirror is a cache, not a gate. Mirror is regenerable — self-heal rewrites it from `.env` on demand. |
| R3.2 | TUI preferences | `~/.lingtai-tui/tui_config.json` | `language: en`, `theme: ink-dark`, `mail_page_size: 200`, `insights: false`, `tool_call_truncate: 0` (no truncation), `auto_refresh: on` | Loaded defaults replace the file silently; no banner (fable F9). |
| R3.3 | Legacy `language` | `~/.lingtai-tui/config.json` `language` | n/a (deprecated) | Migrated to `tui_config.json` by `MigrateLegacyLanguage`; ignored once migrated. |

Other files under `~/.lingtai-tui/` (`utilities/`, `registry.jsonl`) are
self-healing caches regenerated or tolerated on startup — implementation
details, never requirements, never launch gates.

## Startup decision table

The table gates **only** on R1/R2. R3 loss never appears as a launch gate; it
appears as the degraded state below.

| State | Decision |
|---|---|
| No agents in `.lingtai/` (R1 fail) | first-run wizard (create first agent) |
| Agents exist, `config.json` missing or its keys mirror empty (R3.1 loss), `.env` has API keys (R2 ok) | **degraded launch** — derive keys from `.env`, show persistent banner, key-dependent features limited; self-heal offered to regenerate the R3.1 mirror; recovery wizard not forced. Content-based (fable F7): a present-but-keyless mirror degrades exactly like an absent file. |
| Agents exist, `.env` has no API keys (R2 fail) | recovery wizard (real missing key → setup) |
| Agents exist, everything present | normal launch |

## Alignment rules

1. `.env` is the single source of truth for API keys (R2). `config.json` keys
   are an R3.1 mirror; `ResolveKeys` prefers `.env` and fills gaps from the
   mirror for legacy setups.
2. Losing `~/.lingtai-tui/config.json` (or its keys mirror) is an R3 degraded
   condition, not a setup event — the TUI launches with a banner and offers
   self-heal for the regenerable mirror (R3.1). Losing `tui_config.json`
   (R3.2) is the same class but degrades silently: defaults are loaded with
   no banner (fable F9).
3. The doctor validates the startup decision table programmatically
   (fable F8, D1-D5 below): check agents present (R1), `config.json`
   presence (R3.1), `.env` API keys (R2), `.secrets` for declared addons
   (R1), runtime/version (R1).

## Selected-Agent headless control boundary

The only public headless control shape is
`control --project <absolute-.lingtai-dir> --agent <agent-key> <sleep|suspend>`.
The project must resolve to an existing absolute `.lingtai` directory, and the
agent key must name a real Agent directory directly contained within it;
traversal, symlink escapes, non-Agents, and `human` are rejected. Each action
uses the same owner as its interactive command and idempotently writes an empty
`.sleep` or `.suspend` signal. Success emits JSON
`{command,agent,status:"signaled"}` without private agent identity. Invalid
arguments fail without side effects. This boundary explicitly excludes `all`,
`cpr`, `clear`, `refresh`, and `launch`.

## Model list curation

The model ids the TUI offers are a contract with the user: everything the
picker shows must be something the chosen endpoint actually serves today. A
retired id in the list is a 4xx the user did not ask for, and a list that
only ever grows rots into one.

**Two-generation rule.** For every model family, the TUI ships only the
**latest two generations**. This binds:

- `providerModels` (`tui/internal/tui/preset_editor.go`) — the ←/→ picker
  on the editor's model row;
- the default `model` of every built-in preset constructor
  (`tui/internal/preset/preset.go`), which for a picker-bearing provider must
  itself be one of that provider's shipped ids;
- `modelHasVision` (`tui/internal/tui/preset_editor.go`), which carries one
  entry per id in `providerModels` and no entry for a retired one. The
  bijection is what `TestModelHasVisionDeclaresEveryShippedModel` enforces,
  minus two deliberate exemptions it names: `nvidia` (a gateway catalog whose
  per-vendor vision facts we do not verify) and the `claude*` CLI-alias
  spellings. The exemptions apply only to the *requirement* to carry an
  entry — the reverse direction is not exempt: a `modelHasVision` entry for
  an id no picker ships still fails the test. Adding an exemption is a change
  to that test, not a silent omission;
- **not** the providers whose model row is free text. `kimi`, `gemini`,
  `openrouter`, and `custom` have no `providerModels` entry, so they have no
  `modelHasVision` entries either and the bijection test never sees them.
  Their default model is still expected to be a current generation
  (`kimi-for-coding`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `z-ai/glm-5.1`, and `custom`'s
  empty model), but the maps carry nothing for them and must not be given
  entries to "complete" the table — for `kimi` in particular, adding a
  `providerModels` entry flips its row from free text to picker-only and one
  `→` silently overwrites a typed Moonshot id. That deletion is deliberate and
  pinned by a negative assertion in `preset_editor_test.go`.

Reading of the rule:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| family | one vendor's model line — `MiniMax-M*`, `GLM-*`, `mimo-v*`, `deepseek-v*`, `gpt-5.*`, `kimi-k*` |
| generation | the version step within the family — `M3` vs `M2.7`; `GLM-5.2` vs `GLM-5.1`; `gpt-5.6` vs `gpt-5.5` |
| **not** a generation | a variant inside one generation — `-highspeed`, `-pro`, `-flash`, `-mini`, `-Air`, the `gpt-5.6-sol/-terra/-luna` routes, or the same generation respelled for another endpoint (`GLM-5.2` / `glm-5.2`). All variants of a kept generation stay. |
| exempt | catalogs with no generation ladder: CLI aliases naming concurrent tiers (`opus`/`fable`/`sonnet`/`haiku`), and gateway catalogs that list one current id per vendor (`nvidia`). The rule still applies per family inside such a list. Free-text model rows (`kimi`, `gemini`, `openrouter`, `custom`) are outside the `providerModels`/`modelHasVision` bindings entirely — see the fourth clause above. |

**Standing obligation.** Adding a new generation is the same change that
removes the third-newest one — from `providerModels`, from `modelHasVision`,
and from any provider manual under
`tui/internal/preset/skills/lingtai-preset-skill/reference/` that enumerates
the lineup. Never rewrite `presets/saved/`: a user pinned to a retired id
keeps working, the picker just stops offering it.

Per-provider source lists, the rest of the inclusion checklist (served on our
endpoint, GA not preview, documented vision, subscription gates), and the
removal procedure live in `tui/internal/tui/SKILL.md`.

## Doctor checks (TUI-can't-start diagnostic set)

- [x] D1 agents running / orchestrators detected (R1)
- [x] D2 config.json present, readable, and keys mirror non-empty — `ResolveKeys` configOK + `HasAPIKeys(mirror)` (R3.1, content-based fable F7)
- [x] D3 effective API keys present — `HasAPIKeys(resolved)` (.env + mirror gap-fill, matching the gate)
- [x] D4 addon `.secrets`/config present for declared addons (R1; honors declared `mcp.<addon>.env` / legacy `addons.<name>.config` paths)
- [x] D5 runtime/version skew reported (R1, extends existing doctor; plain-release stamps only)

The set is reachable both from the interactive `/doctor` view and the
`lingtai-tui doctor` CLI (fable F5) so the checks that force the first-run /
recovery wizards can be surfaced when the TUI itself cannot start.
